# Code Refractor Homework

With this assignment I followed instructions from the agency and edited the HTML and CSS.
Primarily I made sure all links worked, the title was correct, put in the correct semantics in the code 
and then also indented and organized, making sure that the code  was cleaner than I got it and descriptions
for different sections.

With the CSS I moved around pieces of the code so it followed the flow of the HTML.
